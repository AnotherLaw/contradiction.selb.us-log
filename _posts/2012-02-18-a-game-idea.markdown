title: An idea for a game
author: Minh Nguyen

It came to me this morning, while I continued sketching on with my site redesign. I thought it through a bit, considering school hadn't begun yet. A game, where one attempts to prevent another person's death through their social interactions. This being said, the way in which one interacts may affect one's decisions.

The idea that a little thing said could change one's life can be applied to the reality we live in. One person can start a community. One person can save another from death. One person can influence someone to leave for good.

It truly is amazing how much we can do, even as individuals.

I've already created a little mockup of a menu using [Flashpunk](http://flashpunk.net), and I'll work on it from there, depending upon the workload. This is one of those few projects where I'm hoping I'll get it done for sure. I don't like having to abandon anything.

title: When making a work based on other work
author: Minh Nguyen

I admit that most of my spare time is mostly spent browsing the internet. Partial hobby, partial procrastination method. It's good for that, as well as research. The internet, a multipurpose resource filled with multitudes of articles and things to waste hours away.

But then it hits. And it hits hard, this one thing in particular that you really, really seem to make a connection with. And it's not because it's physically hitting you, I hope. And it's inspiring. You want to make something based on what you've just experienced. Be it a comic, play or novel (or anything in that regard), you're going to do something. 

These things aren't at all easy to do. When I've tried, I've found that it either has the issue of being too much like that work you've experienced, or it's so unlike the universe of the work that you just can't comprehend just how in the world you thought up of that. These two seem to be the big ones for myself (I can't really say for others). So what should you do? What should *I* do?

## What do

Well, one of the things that I could be doing is actually practicing, rather than not. It wasn't as easy when I had exams and the like for the term, but it isn't really an excuse for the amount of procrastinating that I did, just wandering around aimlessly and not doing anything. I reckon that if I had done something over the past few weeks, I might find my abilities improved, but I haven't really done anything to it. The result is decent, but in my standards, decent isn't really going to do it.

Another one is to actually lay off the procrastination. Much of time is spent back stated at the very beginning. With regards to resisting the desire to go about looking at what others have done, I'm not great at that.

## Stacks of failure

As much as one can be inspired, things don't really always have a tendency to work. That I know since I have a really large bank of started-but-never-finished projects. A large number of stories have had starts, but never went anywhere. I've started modelling only to leave partway through. I've drawn scraps that no one else has ever seen. But you shouldn't really be really that discouraged if you find yourself unable to continue with that one idea you thought was good at the time. It all counts as practice, and with it, you can expect better results in the long term. Many times, a novel has been rejected by a publisher no matter how good it was.

Don't be discouraged either if it turns out that your work isn't nearly as good as anyone else's. They've (most likely) had a lot of practice, and have been doing so for quite a while. Gloria Pike's Untitled! went for years to get to what it was by the end. From two variant monotone, occasional colour with filter comics; to heavily detailed panels, the amount of work that you really put into it will have an effect on output. You may have all the time in the world, but you still need to do something.

#contradiction.selb.us/log
A personal log, built upon various things.

##So what is this?
This is the git repository for my newly made subsite, before things get pushed over to the main site [here](http://contradiction.selb.us/log).

That's pretty much how I'm going to put it.

##Running the thing.
You'll need to have [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) installed and functioning before you can run it. If you want to mess around with the CSS, you'll need [sass](http://sass-lang.com) and [compass](http://rubygems.org/gems/compass). To run it, you will need to checkout the local branch, and then do the following commands:

    jekyll --server

And you can access the site through [localhost](http://localhost:4000/log).

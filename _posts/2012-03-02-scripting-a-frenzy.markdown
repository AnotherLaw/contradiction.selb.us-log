title: Scripting a frenzy
author: Minh Nguyen
---
April begins once March ends. And when that comes around, I'll finally dedicate some time to a script that I've been meaning to get writing. [Script Frenzy](http://scriptfrenzy.org/) is sort of like [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org), except it is more towards script writing, something that I'm less used to. The goal? 100 pages of script. This is more loose, at least compared to how NaNoWriMo does it.

I've got a basic plot of adventure planned out, with a new world, new characters, and little if not no relationship at all to my novellas. It's all about experimenting and trying new things. Unless I can get around a huge majority of genres and how they all interact, I can't hope to write well. I have this style of writing that I also need to get out of.

title: Deciding on a static website.

Welcome to my new log, aimed at focusing upon the workings of various things, mostly involving web design and development. As well as that, I may write upon some subjects about the world which might pique one's interest and some of my various projects that I've done over the past few years.

I hope you enjoy your stay.

I got to this stage after getting frustrated from the use of dynamic pages and the manner in which they functioned. With updates here and there, things broke way more frequently than my mind could bear. So I looked around for something that could do me much more better. Having heard about Jekyll being used by a friend, I decided to take a look for myself. It looked like it had a lot of potential, for something that only served static pages. The additional security of not having dynamic pages, and with it the ability to not be limited to a server with MySQL and PHP alone. I could host it anywhere, even if the dreaded possibility of having the current hosting removed were to occur.

Of course, there were plenty of frustrations in trying to get this to work, and it was a simple solution once I found it, especially with how the files were all structured. I now have it functioning, and expect to be alright with it. Which is also why I'll also be publishing this to Github, so I don't end up screwing things over.

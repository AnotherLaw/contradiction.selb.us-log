When it comes through, the result for me is always a disappointment. With the [Ides of March](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_of_March) come and gone, came a dissatisfaction with my work. Everything I've worked for has done little at all for some level of exposure.

## Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite...
I've lost count of the amount of times that I've rewritten and recreated my portfolio site. I've cleared out countless amounts of database tables, put new ones in, and then felt sick afterwards. Numerous times I've tried one thing and another, and yet it still doesn't feel like it's enough.

The issue here would be my expectations. At the stage that they're at, they are simply just too high. I want to create something that's useful and appealing, but that second point is keeping me from focusing on the first.

## You've got a sketch, do it already
A large issue is trying to get frameworks to work with how I want it. Things like ZURB's [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) and Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) is pulling me away from where design should really lie. For others, these frameworks are quite suitable for the purpose intended. But it doesn't seem to quite work for me. Sure, it works in the case where I've received a request with [Bootstrap explicitly](http://contradiction.selb.us/rozznet/), but when it comes to me as my own client, it can become a terrible mess.

My new site won't be based wholly upon these frameworks. I've started along the lines of the [HTML 5 boilerplate](http://www.html5boilerplate.com), and added to it a grid to keep things neat and tidy. Being something quite new, I've decided to avoid utilising Jekyll for page generation for the time being while I figure things out.

## A finished product
I may have this done today, I might not. I'm a bit busy over the next few days, but I'm sure business won't be too hurt as result. I just need to get those few remaining pages done. Then testing. Then uploading.

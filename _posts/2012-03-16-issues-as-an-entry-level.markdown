When it comes through, the result for me is always a disappointment. With the Ides of March come and gone, came a dissatisfaction with my work. Everything I've worked for has done little at all for some level of exposure.

## Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite...
I've lost count of the amount of times that I've rewritten and recreated my portfolio site. I've cleared out countless amounts of database tables, put new ones in, and then felt sick afterwards. Numerous times I've tried one thing and another, and yet it still doesn't feel like it's enough.

The issue here would be my expectations. At the stage that they're at, they are simply just too high. I want to create something that's useful and appealing, but that second point is keeping me from focusing on the first.

## You've got a sketch, do it already
A large issue is trying to get frameworks to work with how I want it. Things like ZURB's Foundation and Twitter's Bootstrap is pulling me away from where design should really lie.

At the end.

title: Sketching redesigns

I've decided today to go ahead with my last post on throwing everything out, and replacing everything with Jekyll. However, before I go ahead and start writing into the code, I need to come up with how it will appear to the user.

##Things to conform to.
For the sake of keeping things rather consistent (not fully), I do need to set some sort of guideline as to how I'll be designing this.

###Fluid layout
The sites in question should be able to be used by all manners of web browsers, including mobile devices, so they should be optimised for access with any device. Images that are placed in these fluid layouts should be able to scale up and down depending on the size of the content.

##The Sketchy Stuff
A few days ago, I came up with a couple of sketches to formulate my design for two sites:

- [My main portfolio site](/log/img/2012/02/17/portfolio-before.png) and...
- [My webcomic site](/log/img/2012/02/17/webcomic-before.png).

For the former, it may be necessary in the long term, whereas the webcomic site requires immediate attention, due to being only in partial progress in design. It's probably one of the more weaker points of my work.
